I have used CNN layers for the feature extraction and LSTM layers followed by TCN (Temporal Convolution network) loss layer. Model is performing poorly on the validation dataset obtained by 80:20 split of the original dataset. The reason for the poor performance is the less number of training  samples or images. This can be overcommed by obtaining large data volumes. The model is performing great on the training images which proves the utility of the approach. 
Following image is obtained after predicting on the training dataset
